# 🏦 Bank Marketing – Machine Learning Analysis

An end-to-end machine learning project focused on analyzing bank customer data
and predicting customer responses using supervised learning techniques.

This project demonstrates professional data science practices including
EDA, feature engineering, preprocessing pipelines, and model evaluation.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement
Banks need to identify customers who are more likely to respond positively
to marketing campaigns.  
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts
customer outcomes based on demographic and behavioral features.
