## 📌 Problem Statement
Banks need to identify customers who are more likely to respond positively
to marketing campaigns.  
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts
customer outcomes based on demographic and behavioral features.

## 🧠 Project Workflow

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data inspection and cleaning
- Missing value handling
- Categorical vs numerical feature analysis
- Target distribution analysis

### 2. Feature Engineering
- Encoding categorical variables
- Handling class imbalance (if present)
- Feature scaling where required

### 3. Modeling
- Train-test split
- Machine learning models (baseline + advanced)
- Cross-validation
- Performance comparison

### 4. Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision / Recall
- F1-score
- Confusion Matrix
